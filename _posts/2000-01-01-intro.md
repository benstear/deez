# Introduction

### So what is DeeZ?

DeeZ (a.k.a. <u>Dee</u>NA-<u>Z</u>ip) is a tool for compressing SAM/BAM files, or more formally,
a tool which does reference-based compression by local assembly. DeeZ was publised in [Nature Methods in November 2014][3].


### How do I get DeeZ?

Just clone our repository and issue `make` command:

	git clone https://github.com/sfu-compbio/deez.git
	cd dz && make -j

Alternatively, use:

	git clone https://bitbucket.org/compbio/dz.git
	git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/deez-compression/deez deez-compression-deez

If you don't have git, you can always fetch pre-packaged DeeZ archives:

-	[.zip package](https://github.com/sfu-compbio/deez/zipball/master)
-	[.tar.gz package](https://github.com/sfu-compbio/deez/tarball/master) 

> **Note**: You will need at least g++ 4.4 to compile the sources.

### How do I use DeeZ?

DeeZ is invoked as following:

#### Compression

	deez -r [reference] [input.sam] -o [output]
	
This will compress `input.sam` to `input.sam.dz`.

#### Decompression

	deez -r [reference] [input.dz] -o [output] ([region])

This will decompress `input.dz` to `input.dz.sam`. `[region]` is optional.

#### Random Access

You can also specify the region of interest while decompressing (i.e. randomly access the region). 
For example, to extract some reads from chr16 to standard output, you should run:

	deez -r [reference] input.dz  -c chr16:15000000-16000000
